>Percent versus index point changes
>
>The movements of the indexes from one month to another are expressed as percent changes rather than changes in index points. Index point changes are affected by the level of the index which, in turn, depends on the time base of the particular index. The percentage change between any two time periods can be readily calculated by dividing the index point difference between the two time periods by the index for the earlier period and multiplying the result by one hundred.
